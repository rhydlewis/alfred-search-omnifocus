# alfred-search-omnifocus

## What is this?

This is a workflow for [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) that performs free text searches
on [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) data.

## Doesn't something like this already exist?

Yes! This workflow is based on [the Search Omnifocus workflow](https://github.com/rhydlewis/search-omnifocus)
which [no longer works](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/kb/python-2-monterey/) with the latest version of macOS. This is
a rewrite in Javascript and uses [Alfy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/alfy) to do the heavy lifting.

## Why would I want such a thing?

Well, I want it because I can't quickly search for, say, a task within OmniFocus using OmniFocus' search field.
OmniFocus restricts search results to the current perspective or
selection. [Other people have noticed this too](https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/how-to-search-all-content-a-via-changed-perspective/366)
.

## How to install

**Pre-requisites**

This workflow relies on Node.js.
Follow [these instructions to install](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html).

1. Install the workflow using `npm`

    `npm install --global alfred-search-omnifocus`

2. Open Alfred Preferences (`alf`) and - if you have the old version of the workflow installed - disable the existing
   workflow "Search Omnifocus" by right clicking on it and unchecking Enabled
3. Run Alfred command `find-of-db` to copy the path of the Omnifocus database to your clipboard. If you have both Omnifocus 3 and Omnifocus 4 installed you will get both paths on your clipboard, and you need to paste the paths somewhere and choose which one you want.
4. Run Alfred command `set-of-db` and then paste (âŒ˜-V) the database path as an argument

> Note, if you're using `zsh`, `fish` or another shell, type `bash` before step 1 to ensure that you install the workflow using the system node.js installation

## Troubleshooting

> I'm seeing errors in the Alfred log related to NODE_MODULE_VERSION or better-sqlite3?

Yes, this has been a pain to resolve. Try this to fix:

1. Open Alfred preferences
2. Right click on the **Search OmniFocus JS workflow** and choose **Open in Terminal**
3. Check that you're using the correct version of node as used by Alfred (as of writing `v18.12.1`)
    `bash`
    `node -v`
4. In your Terminal app - _in the Alfred workflow folder opened in the step before!_ - remove the `node_modules` folder then install the correct packages for your environment by following these commands:
    `rm -rf node_modules/`
    `npm install`
4. Then retry the worfklow

It has also been reported that installing Xcode can resolve this issue.


> Hang on? Why do I have to type `bash`?

Alfred runs the workflow runs from the macOS installed version of bash (/bin/bash) so the workflow version of node.js expects packages that the workflow depends on to be built for the macOS version of node.

## How to use

## Note

This workflow only works with OmniFocus 3 and OmniFocus 4.

### Searching for tasks

* Search for all tasks within OmniFocus (irrespective of status) with `.s`:

### Searching for tasks in the Inbox and the Library

* Search for all tasks within OmniFocus (whether you've processed them or not) with `.se`.

### Searching the inbox

* Search the OmniFocus inbox with `.i`:

![](./images/search-inbox.png)

or just list all tasks in the inbox with `.li`.

### Searching for projects

* Search for projects with `.p`:
